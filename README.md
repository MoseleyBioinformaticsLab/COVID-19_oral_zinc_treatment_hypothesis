## Goal <a name="goal"></a>
**Find a treatment for COVID-19 that prevents hospitalization and/or death that can be developed and used on the timescale of the current 2020 pandemic.**
---

## Hypothesis <a name="hypothesis"></a>
[Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019) is treatable with the oral administration of zinc.
* A possible effective method for the oral administration of zinc is via zinc-infused lozenges that can allow for slow semi-continuous release of zinc in the oral cavity.

## Background <a name="background"></a>
* COVID-19 is caused by the [severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_coronavirus_2).
   * De facto, the acronym COVID-19 is being used to refer to the illness and to the virus that causes the illness.
* SARS-CoV-2 is a strain of the species [severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome-related_coronavirus).
   * Prior designation for the viral strain was 2019-nCoV.
* Another related strain of SARSr-CoV is [severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_coronavirus).

## Rationale For and Evidence Supporting the Hypothesis (Scientific Premise) <a name="rationale"></a>
**There are five major pieces of evidence that form the basis for this hypothesis:**
1. Micromolar levels of intracellular zinc inhibits the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase machinery of nidoviruses, which includes coronaviruses.
    * Specifically, ([Te Velthuis et al., 2010](https://dx.doi.org/10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1001176)) demonstrate inhibition of RNA synthesis from the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase machinery in SARS-CoV infected Vero-E6 cells with 2 micromolar Zn2+ (from zinc acetate) and pyrithione, a zinc-ionophore. The estimated CC50 (toxicity) is 82 micromolar pyrithione with 2 micromolar Zn2+ in Vero-E6 cells, and estimated IC50 (inhibition) is 1.4 micromolar pyrithione with 2 micromolar Zn2+. In contrast, the IC50 is 0.5 micromolar pyrithione with 2 micromolar Zn2+ for the equine arteritis virus.
    * SARS-CoV-2 has an [RNA-dependent RNA polymerase](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/QHD43415/). A BLAST search results in the following matches:
         * QHR63299.1 - orf1ab polyprotein [Bat coronavirus RaTG13] 100% coverage 98.55% identity
         * ACZ71930.1 - orf1ab polyprotein [SARS coronavirus wtic-MB] 100% coverage 86.09% identity
         * NP_127506.1 - replicase ORF1ab polyprotein [Equine arteritis virus] 10% coverage 25.00% identity (14% coverage and 24.86% identity with ACZ71930.1)
     * SARS-CoV has 86.09% identity with SARS-CoV-2 as opposed to 24.86% identity (and a much lower coverage) with EAV.  
2. Zinc is absorbed by oral mucosa cells.  
    * [Kapadia et al., 2018](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=PMID%3A30602641) demonstrated the absorption of zinc by buccal mucosa cells from orthodontic appliances.
3. Efficacy of zinc lozenges for treating common colds is supported by a meta-analysis of prior zinc lozenge studies.
     * A meta-analysis ([Hemilä, H. et al. 2017](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F2054270417694291)) has previously determined that consuming zinc lozenges with a concentration greater than 80 mg zinc / day reduces the common cold duration on average by 33%. A daily dosage up to 150 mg per day has few adverse effects. The lozenges containing zinc gluconate and zinc acetate demonstrated efficacy.
4. SARS-CoV-2 enters cells via the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 receptors.
    * [Hoffman M., et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.31.929042) has shown this and [Xu X., et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11427-020-1637-5) has modeled the structural interaction between ACE2 and the viral spike protein.
5. Oral mucosa expresses ACE2, a major viral receptor of SARS-CoV-2.
    * Xu and coworkers used TCGA and FANTOM5 CAGE gene expression analysis to show this ([Xu H., et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41368-020-0074-x)). However, a simple search of the human protein atlas (HPA) for ACE2 expression corroborates this ([link](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000130234-ACE2/tissue)). In addition, HPA shows the highest expression of TMPRSS2 gene and protein expression in the gastrointestinal tract ([link](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000184012-TMPRSS2/tissue)).

## Potential Implications <a name="implications"></a>
1. Oral mucosa is a primary site of infection for SARS-CoV-2 and the lung is a secondary site of infection.
   * The much lower expression of ACE2 in the lungs would support this.
   * The long asymptomatic period for COVID-19 would support this, if most of the symptoms arise from the infection of the lung epithelium.
2. Treatment of zinc lozenges may only be efficacious before the infection of the lungs.
   * However, zinc lozenge treatment may indirectly reduce the severity of lung infection by preventing continual reinfection from the oral mucosa.  
3. Oral mucosa infection may be the major source of infectious viral particles for spread.
   * If correct, then zinc lozenge treatment may reduce infectivity.
4. Zinc lozenge treatment might be prophylactic in preventing infection of the oral mucosa.
5. Disruption of SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase would also reduce the expression of any immune modulating microRNAs in the viral genome.

## Other Considerations <a name="considerations"></a>
1. Direct treatment of the lungs with zinc is likely toxic and is ill-adviced.
    * [Jiang et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.1080/17435390.2018.1513094) shows that zinc oxide nanoparticles likely causes acute lung injury in a mouse model.
2. Other factors affect oral zinc absorption.
    * [Hemilä et al., 2017](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F2054270417694291) notes that there are some additives that likely lower efficacy, which include: citric acid, tartaric acid, sodium bicarbonate, palm-kernel oil, cotton-seed oil, soy lecithin, mannitol, and sorbitol.
    * [Kashimura et al., 1996](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02784435) demonstrates that dietary addition of [isomalt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomalt) reduces calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus absorption, which is rescued by the dietary addition of acetic acid.
       * This implies that isomalt (major ingredient in sugar-free zinc lozenges) is likely to have a similar repressive effect on zinc absorption.
    * [Henderson et al., 1995](https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/142255/jpen0393.pdf?sequence=1) shows that pH may affect oral zinc absorption like it was demonstrated in the gastrointestinal tract.
    * [Lönnerdal 2000](https://doi.org/10.1093/jn/130.5.1378S) shows that [phytate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytic_acid) negatively affects zinc absorption in the gastrointestinal tract.
    * [Mineo et al., 2004](https://doi.org/10.1023/B:DDAS.0000011613.11671.c7) and [Coudray et al., 2006](https://doi.org/10.1093/jn/136.1.117) provide evidence that zinc gastrointestinal absorption of zinc is enhanced by the difructose anhydrides present in inulin.
3. It is unknown which zinc transporters are present in the oral mucosa.
   * We could not find a published peer-reviewed paper on the likely presence of specific zinc transporters in the oral mucosa. However, [Nishito et al., 2018](https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jnsv/64/1/64_1/_pdf) is a useful review on zinc absorption mechanisms.
4. May be hard to deliver an efficacious dose of zinc to the oral mucosa.
    * [Te Velthuis and coworkers](https://dx.doi.org/10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1001176) have examined the activity of zinc activity on RNA polymerase activities. There are potential differences between the RNA-dependent RNA polymerases of SARS-CoV-2 and coronaviruses that cause the common cold. The need for ionophores is supported by the 3-fold differences in IC50 of pyrithione (i.e. 1.4 micromolar PT for SARS-CoV vs 0.5 micromolar PT for EAV). However, the therapeutic window for ionophores like pyrithione is likely to be much smaller as indicated by the CC50 of 80 micromolar for PT in Vero-E6 cells (African green monkey kidney cells).
5. Zinc transport could be part of chloroquine's mechanism of action in COVID-19 treatment.
    * [Xue et al 2014](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0109180) describes chloroquine as a zinc ionophore.
    * [Colson et al. 2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.105932) describes growing evidence supporting the use of chloroquine (and hydroxychloroquine) in treating COVID-19.

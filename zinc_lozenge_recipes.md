## Introduction <a name="intro"></a>
**This document contains hard candy recipes with infused zinc from zinc gluconate.**  
* The goal is to deliver roughly 120 mg daily dosage of zinc for 10 days in a form that maximizes oral and gastrointestinal absorption of zinc.

## Zinc Dosage Calculation <a name="calc"></a>
* 455.685 g/mol [zinc gluconate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc_gluconate) (C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>22</sub>O<sub>14</sub>Zn)
* 65.38 g/mol zinc
* 120 mg zinc * 10 days = 1.2 g zinc
* (1.2 g zinc * 455.685g zinc gluconate) / 65.38 g zinc = 8.36 g zinc gluconate


## Basic Zinc Lozenge Recipe <a name="basic_recipe"></a>
**The following recipe creates a 10-day dose (or two 5-day doses) of zinc lozenges with 120 mg zinc per day.**

### Ingredients
* 120 g sugar
* 9 g zinc gluconate powder
   * Need to add extra due to the 5% to 10% loss in the recipe (i.e. sticking to pan and mold).
* 50 g light corn syrup
* 40 g water
* teaspoon or two of powdered sugar
* stevia equivalent to 6 teaspoons of sugar (optional)
   * 1 teaspoon of oil, butter, or margarine must be included with the stevia.
* flavoring like vanilla extract or peppermint extract (technically optional, but it is needed to cover the metallic taste)
   * Imitation vanilla flavoring works well and can be added at the beginning.
* coloring (optional)

### Ingredients to Avoid
* Avoid flavorings and colorings that contain citric acid, tartaric acid, sodium bicarbonate, palm-kernel oil, cotton-seed oil, soy lecithin, mannitol, and sorbitol.
   * Cream of Tartar contains tartaric acid.

### Utensils
* small 1-quart sauce pan
* silicone spatula
* candy molds
   * A LorAnn hexagon break-up sheet mold work very well for this recipe.  It creates 84 hexagon lozenges making it easy to take 9 lozenges per day, which spreads the dosage across waking hours.


### Cooking Steps
0. Grease the candy molds with a light oil like canola oil.
1. Add all ingredients to the cooking pan, except the powdered sugar.
   * This is easy to do with a digital kitchen scale that can tare the pan.
   * Many flavorings and colors cannot be added at this time.
      * For instance, vanilla and peppermint extracts which are sensitive to high heat.
1. Put the heat on the stove at slightly above medium heat.
   * This is required to dissolve the zinc gluconate.
   * Normally, hard candy recipes say to dissolve the sugar at low heat, therefore, the pan should be constantly stirred.
1. Stir until everything is dissolved.
1. Turn the heat to high.
   * Within ~30 seconds you may need to break the bubbles with quick stirring of the bubbles to prevent it from boiling over.
   * This is especially true if stevia is added.  Stevia often causes a boil over if not careful.
   * Eventually the over-boiling will subside.
1. Heat until the solution reaches the hard crack stage.
   * This requires reaching 300-310 degrees F, depending on the humidity (310 for high humidity).
   * After a few trials, set a timer for one minute less than the time typically needed to reach 300 degrees F.
   * With practice, one can tell when the hard crack stage is reached, which typically shows as a golden yellow color.
1. Remove from heat and add heat-sensitive flavoring and/or coloring.
1. Pour quickly into the candy mold(s).
1. Let the hard candy cool and break it out of the candy mold(s).
1. Put the candy in a small plastic ziploc, add powdered sugar, and shake to coat with the powdered sugar.
   * The powdered sugar reduces the sticking of individual lozenges.

### Other Points
* The recipe produces 150 to 166 g of zinc lozenges depending on how much is left in the pan or sticks to the candy mold.
* This recipe is easily doubled or tripled.
* There are two storage methods:
   1. Store lozenges in an air-tight container that is dark and at room temperature or slight below room temperature.
      * A small air-tight tin container is very useful for this purpose.    
   1. Store lozenges in an air-tight container in a freezer. (preferred method)
      * A freezer bag around another ziploc bag is a good approach.
      * This method should preserve the lozenges for at least 12 months.

## Sugar-Free Zinc Lozenge Recipes <a name="sugar_free_recipe"></a>
**The following recipe creates a 10-day dose (or two 5-day doses) of sugar-free zinc lozenges with 120 mg zinc per day.**
   * **Warning: this recipe is harder than the basic recipe.**

### Ingredients
* 140 g inulin powder
* 9 g zinc gluconate
   * Need to add extra due to the 5% to 10% loss in the recipe (i.e. sticking to pan and mold).
* stevia equivalent to 30 teaspoons of sugar
* 2 teaspoons of oil (canola oil)
* 200 g water
* flavoring like vanilla extract or peppermint extract (technically optional, but it is needed to cover the metallic taste)
   * Imitation vanilla flavoring works well and can be added at the beginning.
* coloring (optional)

### Ingredients to Avoid
* Avoid flavorings and colorings that contain citric acid, tartaric acid, sodium bicarbonate, palm-kernel oil, cotton-seed oil, soy lecithin, mannitol, and sorbitol.
   * Cream of Tartar contains tartaric acid.
   * Isomalt has a mannitol functional group and should be avoided.

### Utensils
* medium 2-quart sauce pan
* silicone spatula
* candy molds
   * A LorAnn hexagon break-up sheet mold work very well for this recipe.  It creates 84 hexagon lozenges making it easy to take 9 lozenges per day, which spreads the dosage across waking hours.


### Cooking Steps
0. Grease the candy molds with a light oil like canola oil.
1. Add all liquid ingredients to the cooking pan.
   * This is easy to do with a digital kitchen scale that can tare the pan.
   * Many flavorings and colors cannot be added at this time.
      * For instance, vanilla and peppermint extracts.
1. Put the heat on the stove at medium heat.
   * This is required to dissolve the zinc gluconate and the inulin.
   * Cannot easily go above medium heat because it will start to boil.
1. Slowly stir in the non-liquid ingredients, waiting with each addition until everything is dissolved.
   * Be patient. This will require a lot of time stirring.
   * May need to add extra water if everything does not dissolve.  
   * Do not include the splenda.  It is used at the end.
1. Turn the heat to high.
   * Within ~30 seconds you may need to break the bubbles with quick stirring of the bubbles to prevent it from boiling over.
   * This will require a lot of effort and you may need to remove the pan from the heat momentarily.
   * This is due to the stevia.  The oil helps with this, but does not prevent all of the over-boiling.
   * Eventually the over-boiling will subside.
1. Heat until the solution reaches the hard crack stage.
   * This requires reaching 300-310 degrees F, depending on the humidity (310 for high humidity).
   * After a few trials, set a timer for one minute less than the time typically needed to reach 300 degrees F.
   * With practice, one can tell when the hard crack stage is reached, which typically shows as a golden yellow color.
1. Remove from heat and add heat-sensitive flavoring and/or coloring.
1. Pour very quickly into the candy mold(s).
   * You do not have a lot of time, so be quick to get it into the molds.
1. Let the hard candy cool and then put it into the freezer.  
1. After a few hours, take it out of the freezer and break it out of the candy mold(s).
1. Put the candy in a small plastic ziploc, add powdered splenda, and shake to coat with the powdered splenda.
   * The powdered splenda reduces the sticking of individual lozenges.
1. Then roll sets of 8 lozenges in either wax paper or plastic wrap.
1. Place this roll of lozenges into a clean ziploc back.

### Other Points
* The recipe produces ~140 g of zinc lozenges depending on how much is left in the pan or sticks to the candy mold.
* Doubling of this recipe is not recommended, due to the limited time to pour it into the candy mold.
* Technically, this candy does not actually reach the hard crack stage.  
   * This candy is probably at a soft crack stage, which is why it must be put into the freezer in order to break it out of the mold.
   * This is also why the lozenges need to be rolled up in wax paper or plastic wrap, in order to prevent them from sticking together.
* Store lozenges in an air-tight container in a freezer.
   * A freezer bag around another ziploc bag is a good approach.
   * This method should preserve the lozenges for at least 12 months.
